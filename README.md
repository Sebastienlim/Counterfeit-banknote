# Counterfeit-banknote
# Project Overview
Your IT consulting company offers you a new assignment at the Ministry of the Interior as part of the fight against organized crime, specifically at the Central Office for the Suppression of Counterfeiting. Your mission is to create an algorithm for counterfeit banknote detection.

# Step by step
You will perform a principal component analysis of the sample, following these steps:

● Scree plot analysis of eigenvalues

● Representation of variables using the correlation circle

● Representation of individuals using factorial planes

● Analysis of representation quality and individual contribution

For each of these steps, please provide comments on the obtained results. The variable indicating the True/False nature of the banknote will be used as an illustrative variable.

Apply a classification algorithm and analyze the obtained result.

Visualize the partition obtained in the first factorial plane of the PCA and analyze it.

Model the data using logistic regression. With this, you will create a program capable of making predictions on a banknote, determining whether it is genuine or counterfeit. For each banknote, your classification algorithm should provide the probability that the banknote is genuine. If this probability is equal to or greater than 0.5, the banknote will be considered genuine. Otherwise, it will be considered counterfeit.
